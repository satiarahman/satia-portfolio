Personal Portfolio built with Next.js (App Router). Styled to match `base.html`.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Pages
- `/` About
- `/experience` Experience
- `/gallery` Gallery

The theme toggle persists in `localStorage` and switches `data-theme` on the root element.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
